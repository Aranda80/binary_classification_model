# Binary Classification Model


This application creates a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by the Company. This model will be built using machine learning and neural networks. The Company provided a dataset that contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from the Company over the years.


## Steps:

    1- Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

    2- Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.

    3- Optimize the neural network model. 
    
    4- Models comparison and Results



## Tecnologies required and installation guide:

* **TensorFlow**

``` pip install --upgrade tensorflow```

    - To verify the installation:
    ``` python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.__version__)"```

* **Keras**

``` python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)" ```

## Instructions

Use the `GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb` notebook to create the binary classifier model.
